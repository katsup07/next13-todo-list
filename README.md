This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## Database
A database needs to be setup in the prisma > schema.prisma file. A local MySQL database can be quickly setup for development purposes.

## Known Issues
- The edit todo updates correctly in the database, but the refresh on the client is too quick so an extra reload is needed to display the most recent data. <br/>
- After updating an todo in the database, the client still continues to use old(cached?) data on the edit page.<br/>
<br/>
These issues be fixed in the future.
<br/>

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
